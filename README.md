# How To Use ChatGPT and get UNFAIR Advantage (as a developer)

I have something to confess. I have been using ChatGPT almost every day forÂ aÂ coupleÂ ofÂ months now. My job knowsÂ and it's all about speed, but other developers may see it as cheating.

This short article WILL give you an unfair advantage if you are a mid to senior developer!

## How I use ChatGPT and why
I use CGPT for everything. Typing, designing projects, debugging, reverbing, getting known with legacy code faster...
It's mostly just pasting my code and errors in CGPT, but if you want to know some additional tricks, read on.

## Machines will always type faster.
Sure, you know how to write a simple fuse or a translation from language to language, but can you type it as fast as a machine? I didn't think so.
Write everything in a prompt, and paste it in your IDE, change only what you haven't declared good enough in a prompt and take a note of it, so you will use even less time next time.
Machines can type faster, that's a fact. Don't fool yourself. Use CGPT!

Example prompt:

```Write this code in PHP. I have 3 variables: number0, number1 and number2. Make a while loop that will count from number0 to number2, and every 4th time etherate number1. Use inline logic and make it short.```

## Debugging
If the error is about a big pile of code, I only paste in my error soÂ I can understand it better. If the error is about a short part of code, or I can't debug it using the first strategy I paste in this part of code and an error. That normally suffices. Sometimes I need to tell CGPT things like ```This code is in NodeJS, this is my package.json``` or ```I can't use -function-```.

## Translating
Just start your prompt with: ```I need this code translated in PHP -code-```. You will probably need some modifications after you get your answer.

## Building the solution from scratch
Watch everything you can about the technology on Youtube. More that you know about concepts and got-chas about it, the better the final solution will be. For instance: How to prepare your image for OCR.
Then type the whole procedure in CGTP. 

Reading documentation is also a plus.

## Getting to know THE LEGACY
First I read code myself. Try to understand it as much as I can. Then I just paste the old code in CGPT and read an output.

## But I want more!
You can buy CGPT 4. IMHO is not worth it if you are not working on the cutting edge. And If you do, it wouldn't help you that much any way. It's mostly about Plugins, but I haven't found anything that you can't do with a normal CGPT. For instance: ```Show me the whole code.```

Have fun being 500% faster and don't forget to use your brain as much as you can! 

Also FFS, don't paste password, usernames, secrets and secret sauces in CGPT! And don't forget to learn.
